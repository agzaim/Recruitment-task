It’s a simple Q&A app, based on  three layouts:

The next part of the task was to make them responsive. I didn’t want to use any CSS framework for this and I solved it by myself.
</br>
</br>
Third part was about building a modal with user profile and writing the logic for displaying it when user avatar or name was clicked.
</br>
</br>
Then I was supposed to use templates in every place that can potentially hold varying content and fill it with data from collections. I decided to use Vue.js to achieve it.
</br>
</br>
Next step was to add functionalities to:
* sorting buttons (sorting by date and by number of votes),
* search form to show only items related to provided query,
* “load more” button to show additional number of questions within this view,
* voting arrows to give the viewers chance to rate entries as helpful or not.
</br>
</br>
The last part of the task was to combine all views in single app and make them switch without reloading browser.
